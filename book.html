        <h2>About This Book: A Meditation on Seeing</h2>
        <h3>The Artist's Vision</h3>
        <p><em>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird</em> is not an illustration of Wallace Stevens' iconic poem—it's a visual meditation inspired by it. Each of the photographs corresponds to a line from the poem, creating "further thoughts or personal interpretations" that emerged from reading Stevens' work. Rather than depicting literal blackbirds, the images explore what it means to transcend the ordinary and find poetry in everyday moments.</p>

        <h3>The Art of Transcending the Ordinary</h3>
        <p>Jonathan Leavitt describes his approach as an effort to overcome "the triteness and banality" of familiar subjects. "Reality is cliché; it is our job to transcend it," he explains. The photographs capture scenes we've all witnessed—a person walking a dog, hands interacting, figures in urban spaces—but transform them into something deeper through careful observation and timing.</p>
        <p>"When capturing images there is no time to think; it is time to fall back on reflexes," Leavitt notes. The magic happens in those split seconds when ordinary life "arranges itself into a poem"—moments that require the photographer to be ready before they unfold.</p>

        <h3>Black and White as Poetry</h3>
        <p>The choice of black-and-white photography is intentional and philosophical. Leavitt explains that monochrome "automatically imposes a first layer of separation and abstraction from reality". This aesthetic choice, combined with what he calls "inky blacks," creates the visual foundation for metaphorical thinking. The rich tonal range—achieved through meticulous printing processes—serves as "the anchor for all these photos but one".</p>

        <h3>A Personal Journey Through the World</h3>
        <p>This work is "autobiographical but not in a literal way". Rather than telling specific stories, the photographs reveal "what it feels like to me, to move through the world". Created over four years of patient observation, the book represents a sustained meditation on perception, inviting viewers to see familiar scenes with fresh eyes and discover the profound within the seemingly mundane.</p>
        <p>"I hope that with the new universal abundance and availability of photography, people do not forget the 'taste' of a great photograph," Leavitt reflects, positioning this work as a reminder of photography's capacity for poetic transformation.</p>
